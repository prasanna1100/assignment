# ### Assumptions in Multilinear Regression
# - Linearity: The relationship between the predictord and the response is linear
# - Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
# - Homoscedasticity: The residuals (difference between observed and predicted values)exihibit constant variance at all levels of the predictor
# - Normal Distribution of Errors: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.
# - No Multicollinearity:The independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other Violations of these assumptions may lead to in efficeincy in the regression parameters and unreliableÂ predictors

# ### Description of columns
# - MPG : Milege of the car (Mile per gallon)
# - HP  : Horse Power of the car
# - VOL : Volume of the car (Sixe of the car)
# - SP  : Top speed of the car (Miles per hour)
# - WT  : Weight of the car (Pounds)

cars.info()


# In[8]:


# Check for missing values
cars.isna().sum()


# ### Observations
# - No missing values are observed.
# - There are 81 observations
# - The data types of each column is relevant and valid with respect to the columns.
